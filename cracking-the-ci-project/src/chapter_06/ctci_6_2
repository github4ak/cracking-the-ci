Solution  to 6.2

Probability of wining playing Game-1 = p

Probability of wining playing Game-2 = 3*p^2*(1-p) + p^3

So choose Game 1 over Game 2 when,

p > 3p^2 - 2*p^3

1 > 3p - 2p^2 

2p^2 - 3p + 1 > 0

(p - 1/2)(p - 1) > 0

Since, p < 1 , second term will always be negative, so 

(p - 1/2) < 0 for Game-1 to win or p < 0.5 - choose Game-1 else choose Game-2
