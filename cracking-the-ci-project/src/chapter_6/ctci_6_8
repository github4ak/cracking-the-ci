Solution to 6.8

Imp: Worst-case load balancing

The idea is sum of drops(egg-1) + drops(egg-2) should be balanced,

So, if we start with Egg-1 at Floor-X , then the next drop should be at Floor-X + (X-1) and so on,

So, we see X + X - 1 + X - 2 + X - 3 + ... + 1 = 100

Or, X(X+1)/2 = 100 ~ X is 13.65, logically argue for rounding up to 14.
